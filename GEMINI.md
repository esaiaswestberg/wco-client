To attempt to build, like to check for build errors, run: `./gradlew assembleDebug`.
To run within the Google TV emulator, use `./run_emulator.sh`.
To check the logs from the emulator, use `adb logcat -s WCO_TV WCO_TV_JS WCO_TV_PLAYER`, other filters might be applicable for what you are working on, and not all are required.
